  abstractnote = {The Open Visualization Tool (OVITO) is a new 3D visualization software designed for post-processing atomistic data obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Unique analysis, editing and animations functions are integrated into its easy-to-use graphical user interface. The software is written in object-oriented C++, controllable via Python scripts and easily extendable through a plug-in interface. It is distributed as open-source software and can be downloaded from the website http://ovito.sourceforge.net/.},

  abstractnote = {This is the workflow, which includes the LAMMPS and shell scripts, to run simulations which reproduce the minimized structure and coupling behavior to shear deformation acting on a (Sigma37(610)) symmetric-tilt grain boundary (i.e., bicrystal) of copper as reported in J. Cahn, et al., Acta materialia, 2006.  In this setup we are using the EAM potential of Y. Mishin, et al., PRB, 2001. The compressed tarball contains the bicrystal configuration file and a result at (T=298,K) with shear velocity of (v = 0.01;text{Ang. /ps}). The scripts follow as closely as possible the computational methodology as expressed in J. Cahn, et al., Acta materialia, 2006. These scripts have been tested up to LAMMPS 1 Feb 2014 = stable version, tag = r11423.},

  abstractnote = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that normal grain boundary (GB) motion must often be coupled to tangential translation of grains and will then produce shear deformation of the lattice traversed by the GB. Conversely, shear stresses applied to a GB can induce its normal motion. Using [001] symmetrical tilt GBs in copper as a model, the coupling factor β between the GB motion and grain translations has been calculated by MD simulations over the entire misorientation range and a wide range of temperatures. The coupling factor is multivalued, can be positive or negative, and shows an abrupt switch from one branch to another at a tilt angle of about 35°. At high temperatures the response of high-angle GBs to shear changes from coupling to sliding until coupling disappears. No sliding is observed for low-angle GBs up to near the melting point. A geometric model of coupling proposed in this work predicts the misorientation dependence of β in excellent agreement with MD results and relates the multivalued character of β to the point symmetry of the crystal. Two kinds of low-angle GBs with different dislocations occur when the tilt angle is small and again when it approaches 90°. In these limits, the multiplicity of β is explained by different Burgers vectors of the dislocations. The results of this work are summarized as a temperature–misorientation diagram of mechanical responses of GBs. Unsolved problems and future work in this area are discussed.},
